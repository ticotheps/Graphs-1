# - Graph Data Structures
  # - What are they?
    #  - collections of data that are represented by nodes and the connections
    #    between them.

  # - What are they comprised of?
    # - "Nodes" (or "vertices")
      # - represent objects in a data set
      # - i.e. - cities, animals, web pages
    # - "Edges"
      # - connections between vertices; can be BIDRECTIONAL (point in both
      #   directions to indicate a two-way relationship)
    # - "Weights"
      # - the "cost" to travel across an edge
      # - only assigned to edges (not nodes)
      
  # - What are they useful for?
    # - illustrating or representing relationships between entities
      # - i.e. - social networks, physical networks (cell towers), cities, etc.
      
  # - What kinds of graphs exist?
    # - "Directed Graphs"
      # - can only move in ONE direction along edges
    # - "Undirected Graphs"
      # - allows movement in BOTH directions along edges
    # - "Weighted Graphs" 
      # - allows the edges (between vertices/nodes) to have weights on them.
    # - "Unweighted Graphs" 
      # - does not allow the edges (between vertices/nodes) to have weights on them.
    # - "Cyclic Graphs"
      # - the edges of this graph allow you revisit at least one vertex during traversal.
    # - "Acyclic Graphs"
      # - nodes/vertices that can be visited only ONCE during traversal
